# PizzaPlace
This project was to develop an order system that returned an itemized receipt for a mock pizza restaurant.

Challenge:  Create a webpage with an interactive menu and receipt system using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a 
fictional pizza place.  The menu had to include a variety of sizes, crusts, sauce, cheese, meat and vegetable options.
The menu also needed to print out an itemized receipt with subtotal and total values.  There were a few added stipulations 
in that certain items cost an additional charge(denoted on the menu) also the fact that the first meat and vegetable 
selection were free, but all others after were an additional $1.

Result:  You can see how the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript combined to form a seamless experience.

Outcome:  I feel that this exercise really deepened my knowledge of JavaScript as well as basic HTML and CSS concepts. 
This project presented an array of challenges in making a functional webpage that could be used in real world applications.
I really enjoyed working on this project, even though I found it to be challenging.  I hope that idea is visible in the work
that I completed on the project.
